function samples = make_mult_norm(mu,cov,num_sample)% Note- This is an adjustment of gensample from the GRT toolbox.% We start with a matrix containing num_sample values from a standard% normal distribution of the desired dimension.X = randn(length(mu),num_sample);% Next we recall that if we form Y = A*X, then the covariance of Y will be% given by K = A*A'.  So we need to find A such that% A*A' = K.  The cholesky decomposition does this.A = chol(cov)';% We now form Y = A*X and add the means in each dimensionsamples = (A*X)'+ ones(num_sample,length(mu))*diag(mu);
